            It is difficult to talk about oneself but on this page I'm going to try my best to do just that.

            I am interested in a lot of random things. Here is a breif list of them.

        <ul style="text-align:left">
            <li>I'm a big fan of music but unfortunately I don't know how to play any instrument. My favorite genres are hip-hop, RnB , Rock , Indie. Now that i think about it I'm a big fan of anything that comes along.</li>
            <li>I'm a huge fan of Photography. I started off on a small point and shoot Sony trying to take bookeh pictures of random scenario and then upgraded to a Nikon D600 later. You can find a taste of my photography <a style="color:red" href="photos.html">here.</a></li>
            <li>I love films. Stanley kubrick is my favorite Director. I hate action movies and can proudly state I slept when I first saw the Avengers. I want to be a Director someday.</li>
            <li>I also love reading books. I love old classics and recently I've been trying to read non-fiction but I am very bad at managing time so most of the reading I do these days is on Twitter.</li>
        </ul>

            I played tennis for 5 years at Qatar Tennis Federation (QTF) and got pretty good at it. Participated in a total of one tennis tournament and got badly beaten and never played in tournaments again.
        </p>
            I also won the CBSE clusters in Qatar but didn't play a single game. My teammate was a pro so he carried me.
